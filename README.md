TPM2137
=======

This is a RE challenge for WCTF2019. Each team is given a unique binary file to reverse engineer and everything in the `description/` directory.

For an overview of the challenge, and how it's solved, see the [presentation slides we gave at WCTF](WCTF2019 - TPM2137.pdf).

If you want to give it a shot yourself, see [the description directory](description).
